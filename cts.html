        <h1>Renaissance Quadratics </h1>
        <p>The next time you have thoughts that tell you "algebra sucks," consider Renaissance math.</p>

        <p><br>The people of that era, especially in Europe, didn't have aldebra to solve problems such as quadratics.  </p>
        <p><br>In fact, their geometrical systems didn't even allow them to use negative numbers, meaning they had six different quadratic equations arranged so that each term would be positive.</p>

        <p>Let's take the equation x^2 + 26x = 27</p>

        <p><br>Mathematicians would think of the x^2 term as a suqare with a side length of x and the 26x term as a rectangle with side lengths of 26 by x; the area of those shapes will add to 27.</p>

        <p>In order to visualize what goes on in this process, we must first split the rectangle in half and arrange it so that we make a square with sidelengths of x + 13.</p>

        <p>You may notice a piece of our square is missing, however, we already know the dimensions of that smaller square, 13x13.</p>

        <p>By completing our bigger square via adding a smaller square, we are adding 169, the smaller square's area, to our equation.</p>

        <img id="logo" src="images/cts4.png" alt="cts photo 3" width="600">

        <p>(Keep in mind that 169 must be added to both sides in order to maintain the equasion's equality)</p>

        <p>Now that we have the square's total area, 196 (which is 27 + 169), we can find out that the side lengths are 14.</p>

        <img id="logo" src="images/cts5.png" alt="cts photo 3" width="600">

        <p>If the side length is 14 and we know it's also x + 13, we can set 14 = x + 13, meaning x = 1</p>
