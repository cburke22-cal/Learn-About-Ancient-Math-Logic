            <h1>Babylonean Multiplication</h1>
            <p>Ancient civilizations had a wierd way of doing math, but their methods still worked.  It may be difficult to understand how their math worked, however, this site is here to help with that.</p>

            <p>If you don't know who the Babyloneans were, here's a short description.</p>

            <p><br>The Babyloneans were an ancient civilization that had a system where, instead of ours which has a base of 10, they had a base of 60.  It might seem too complicated for every day calculations, but it did have it's perks.  One of them is that the number 60 has many factors, allowing better calculations with fractions.</p>

            <p><br>Now, let's look at their multiplication</p>

            <p><br>Firstly, I'm pretty sure nobody knows how their multiplication works.  I've searched everywhere and found nothing that explains why they do things the way they do.</p>

            <p><br>Thus, the following will be my interpretation of their math.</p>

            <h1><br><br>N/A</h1>

            <p><br><br>I'm going to have to refer you to a site called widuski.net, as I don't have enough time to understand a number system with a base of 60, learn how they divided by multiplying by their divisor-reciprocal, and put that into a cohesive explaination for people to read.<br><br>I wish you the best of luck.</p>
